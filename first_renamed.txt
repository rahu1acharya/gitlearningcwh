In the quiet of the morning light,
When dawn whispers secrets so bright,
Nature wakes in a gentle grace,
Painting smiles on the worldâ€™s face.

The flowers sway in a breezy dance,
As sunbeams twirl in a golden trance.
Birds sing songs of hope anew,
A chorus in the skies of blue.

Embrace the day with heart and soul,
Let every moment make you whole.
For in the simple joys we find,
A tapestry of life, beautifully intertwined.
